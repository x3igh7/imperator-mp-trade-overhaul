Complete overhaul of the value of trade goods and their benefits.

Value was calcuated based on rarity of the good within the world. The rarest goods are compel nations to war over their control; meanwhile the most abundent goods won't bring in much cash, 
but have interesting bonuses that can encourage stockpiling them. 

A surplus of stone is now required to build forts (unless building within a capital city). This change is to encourage more strategic and purposful placement of forts.

There are also some minor adjustments to what resources will spawn when creating a new city so as to preserve the general rarity of certain goods.
