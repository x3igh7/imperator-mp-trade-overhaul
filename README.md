Complete overhaul of the value of trade goods and their benefits.

Value was calcuated based on rarity of the good within the world. The rarest goods compel nations to war over their control; meanwhile the most abundent goods won't bring in much cash, 
but have interesting bonuses that can encourage stockpiling them. 

A surplus of stone is now required to build forts (unless building within a capital city). This change is to encourage more strategic and purposful placement of forts.

Large supluses of goods will are now required to fields certain units. In order to build Heavy Infantry or Heavy Cavalry, 3 iron must be available in a provice. 
Additionally, all other units require 2 units of their respective good to enable their special unit (i.e. Light Cavalry require 2 horses).
These changes hopes to encourage nations to exploit and control important strategic resources.

There are also some minor adjustments to what resources will spawn when creating a new city so as to preserve the general rarity of certain goods.
